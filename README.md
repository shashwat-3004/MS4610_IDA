## Problem Statement & Objective
A bank offers two types of cards: Charge cards and lending cards. An individual can apply for any one of the two types of card. In order to extend the card to individuals, banks must first underwrite the applicant. Underwriting is the process by which the lender decides whether an applicant is creditworthy and should receive a credit line. Along with the data present in application forms, banks also have access to the consumer bureau. Bureau is an agency that aggregates consumer borrowing and payment information for the purpose of assessing the creditworthiness of an individual and setting a limit on the cumulative credit that can be extended to an individual by lenders.

The objective is to predict if an applicant goes default or not in the next 12 monthsmfrom a new credit card application. A set of 51 features has been given. Customer application data and bureau data with the default tagging, i.e., if a customer has missed a cumulative of 3 payments across all open trades, his default indicator is “1” else “0”. The data consists of independent variables at the time T0 and the actual performance of the individual (Default/ Non Default) after 12 months.
